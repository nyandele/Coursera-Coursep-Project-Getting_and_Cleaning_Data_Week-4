# Files
The following files are contained in this repository:
- CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the work that I performed to clean up the data
- run_analysis.R: an R script outlining the data preparation steps, followed by the 6 steps required by the course projectâ€™s definition:
      - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
      - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- FinalData.txt: the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
